                <h3>Favorite CMSC Subject</h3>
                <p>My favorite CMSC subject so far is CMSC 21. I think that drawing and directing pointers
                    is fun (although the subject definitely is stressful).

                <h3>Favorite GE</h3>
                <p>My favorite GE is Arts 1 since I have learned a lot from our readings that I didn't know
                    at first. I have appreciated art and its impact in society more after taking this course.

                <h3>Favorite Programming Language</h3>
                <p>Java is my favorite programming language because of its features. It was definitely new to me
                    and served as a challenge for me to be better at my chosen field of career.
